    "**1) Data Description**  \n",
    "**Introduction:** The data analyzed in this project were collected from a Minecraft research server hosted by the Programming Languages for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) Group at UBC. The objective of the study is to better understand player behavior and engagement in a controlled gaming environment. Players interact with the game server, and both their demographic details and gameplay actions are recorded.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**players.csv:** This file consists of 7 different variables and contains demographic and account-related information for each unique player. There is 196 different observations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Variables in players.csv:**  \n",
    "1) experience: This is a character variable, it specifies the players specific experience level. It is categorized into Veteran, Pro, Regular, Amateur, and Beginner.  \n",
    "2) subscribe: This is a logical variable, it specifies whether the player is subcribed or not. It is categorized into TRUE or FALSE.  \n",
    "3) hashedEmail: This is a character variable, it contains the players email in a hashed format. This anonymizes the email information.  \n",
    "4) played_hours: This is a numerical variable (dbl). It contains the total number of gameplay hours per player. The mean number of hours player per player is 5.85 hours, the minimum is 0 hours, the max is 223.1 hours.     \n",
    "5) name: This is a character variable, it contains the players chosen name for the game.  \n",
    "6) gender: This is a character variable, it contains the players specified gender.  \n",
    "7) Age: This is a numerical variable (dbl). It contains the players age. The mean value for age is 21.14 years old, the minimum is 9 years old, and the maximum is 58.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Errors in players.csv**  \n",
    "Some players have missing Age values, which is a concern because it reduces the completeness of the data and could bias any analysis or predictions that rely on age as an important demographic factor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**sessions.csv** This file contains 5 different variable sand includes information on individual gameplay sessions recorded in the game. Each row captures a single gameplay session linked to a player. There is 1535 different observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables in sessions.csv**  \n",
    "1) hashedEmail: This is a character variable, it contains the players email in a hashed format. This anonymizes the email information.  \n",
    "2) start_time: This is a character variable, it contains the gameplay session start time in the DD/MM/YYYY and HH:MM format.  \n",
    "3) end_time: This is a character variable, it contains the gameplay session end time in the DD/MM/YYYY and HH:MM format.\n",
    "4) original_start_time: This is a numerical variable (dbl). It contains the UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) corresponding to the session start time.  \n",
    "5) original_end_time: This is a numerical variable (dbl). It contains the UNIX timestamp (in milliseconds) corresponding to the session end time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Errors in sessions.csv**  \n",
    "This dataset contains missing values in the end_time and original_end_time columns, and the time data are stored in two different formats (human-readable strings and UNIX timestamps), which will need to be cleaned and transformed before calculating useful information such as session duration.  \n",

    "**2. Question:** Can player demographics and gameplay behavior predict whether a player is subscribed to the game newsletter?  \n",
    "To address this question, I will first merge the players.csv dataset with sessions.csv using the common hashedEmail identifier. I will compute useful behavioral metrics such as the total number of sessions and average session duration for each player. These variables, along with existing demographic features (e.g., age, experience, played_hours), will form the predictor set. I will then standardize numeric variables and encode categorical ones as needed to prepare the data for use in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This wrangling will ensure the dataset is tidy and suitable for analysis."
